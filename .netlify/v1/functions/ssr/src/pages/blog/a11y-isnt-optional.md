# Designing for accessibility is the right thing to do

The fact that the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA</a> (Americans with Disabilities Act) exists at all is an indictment of our innate self-centeredness. It's evidence of our fallen nature as humans. Because business owners prioritized profit over people, they didn't voluntarily make their buildings accessible to people with disabilities so the US government had to force us to do it through legislation and penalties.  

That's embarrasingly bad. But you and I can do better in our web apps. 

Accessibility (or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a11y</a>) is the art and science of making apps usable for people with disabilities which is an incredible <a href="https://accessiblyapp.com/blog/web-accessibility-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20% of the population</a>!

It's way more than just a legal requirement or a checkbox on your to-do list. It’s about empathy, ethics, and creating a world where everyone can thrive. It’s an ethical decision that reflects who we are as creators and as a society.

## It’s about people, not profit

Some of us approach a11y as a legal requirement (<a href="https://eye-able.com/blog/accessibility-laws-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which it is</a>) or a way to avoid expensive lawsuits (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_the_Blind_v._Target_Corp." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/netflix-and-deaf-rights-group-settle-suit-over-video-captions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/h-r-block-others-to-offer-net-tax-services-to-blind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is</a>). But that’s a pretty shallow view. The real motivation should be about people. It’s about creating a web that’s inclusive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. 

Let’s be real: We all want to make the world a better place, right? Designing with a11y in mind is a fundamental way to do that. It’s about empathy. It’s about understanding that not everyone experiences the web the same way you do. Some people rely on <a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/factsheets/introduction-screen-readers#:~:text=A%20screen%20reader%20is%20a,or%20have%20very%20limited%20vision." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screen readers</a>, others navigate with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/18kb8ex/comment/kdqgq7e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keyboard shortcuts (⚠️ slightly NSFW)</a>, and some may have <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/cognitive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cognitive disabilities</a> that require clear, straightforward content.

When you take the time to make your web apps accessible, you’re not just following a set of guidelines; you’re actively working to dismantle barriers that exclude people from participating in the digital world. Can it get better than working to make life better for others?

## How to make a difference

So, how do we make this happen? Here are a few things you can do to start prioritizing accessibility in your projects:

- **Lobby your bosses**: Show them this article or other better-written ones. Explain that accessibility isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a must-have. It’s not just about avoiding lawsuits; it’s about doing the right thing. The more we talk about it, the more it becomes a priority.
- **Start Small**: You don’t have to overhaul your entire app overnight. Start with small changes, like using semantic HTML, adding alt text to images, and ensuring your color contrast is sufficient. Toss in a few ARIA attributes here and there. Every little bit helps.
- **Educate Yourself** ... There are tons of resources: <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogs, <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/accessibility-testing-and-screen-reader/table-of-contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courses</a>, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube<a/> playlists dedicated to accessibility. Take some time to learn the different types of disabilities and how they affect web usage.

## Let’s change the story

At the end of the day, designing for accessibility is about more than just compliance or profit margins. It’s about creating a world where everyone can thrive, regardless of their abilities. It’s about making the internet a place where everyone feels welcome and included.

So, let’s change the narrative! Let’s make accessibility a fundamental part of our work as developers. Because when we design for everyone, we’re not just building better apps. We’re building a better world. And that’s something we can all get behind.
