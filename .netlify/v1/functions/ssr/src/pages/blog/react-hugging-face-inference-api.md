So you want to write and host an API that uses a pretrained machine learning model? Maybe your client needs to be alerted when a user enters a scary comment on their website. Is the customer angry? Impatient? Happy? Within a few minutes, you can add this capability to your site. Here's how.

There are a few [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

## Step 1: Pick out a Hugging Face model

Hugging Face has tons of pretrained models. You just need to pick one that fits your needs. 

1. Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models).
On the left there are over 50 categories of models. You'll see categories like:
  - Text Classification
  - Text Generation
  - Image Classification
  - Object Detection
  - Speech Recognition
  - and more...

2. Click on a category. 

For this tutorial, we're trying to get our React app to detect the mood of the user. That's a text classification problem. So we'll look under the **Natural Language Processing** section and choose **Text Classification**.

1. Scroll back up to the top and click on **Other**. Then choose **Select all** under **Inference Provicers**.

You now see a list of models that will solve your real-world problem <u>and</u> can be accessed via an API.

![Filtering models by inference provider and category](https://res.cloudinary.com/rappayne/image/upload/v1747235468/hf_models_search_i2kmki.png)

Cool, right? ðŸ¥³ Browse through and click on any model you want. 

I'm going to use <a href="https://huggingface.co/SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions</a> for this demo.


## Step 2: Learn to use the model
As you clicked on the model, you see its details which include a button that says **Deploy**. Click it and choose **Inference Providers**. 

![Inference Providers are found under the deploy button](https://res.cloudinary.com/rappayne/image/upload/v1747235159/hf_models_all5bp.png)

In the modal window, you'll see how-to code snippets in a number of languages. Choose JavaScript and click that lovely **Copy** button.

The model I chose says to use it like this:
```javascript
async function query(data) {
  const response = await fetch(
  "https://router.huggingface.co/hf-inference/models/SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions",
  {
    headers: {
     Authorization: "Bearer hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
     "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });
  const result = await response.json();
  return result;
}

query({ inputs: "I like you. I love you" }).then((response) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response));
});
```

Do you see that Authorization header? That's your Hugging Face API key. You'll  use [your own key](https://agilegadgets.com/blog/hugging-face-api-keys-made-easy). 

## Step 3: Make your React app consume the web API 
1. Edit your React website. Here's a simple SentimentAnalysis.jsx that reads a text box.

```javascript
import { useActionState } from 'react';

export const SentimentAnalysis = () => {
  const fetchMoodOnFormSubmit = async (prevState, formData) => {
    const message = formData.get('message');
    const mood = "TBD";  // <-- WILL BE FETCHED FROM HUGGING FACE SOON
    return { message, mood };
  }

  const [state, dispatchFunction, isPending] = useActionState(fetchMoodOnFormSubmit, undefined)

  return (
    <div>
      <form action={dispatchFunction}>
        <label>Your comments:<textarea name="message" required></textarea></label>
        <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
          {isPending ? 'Analyzing...' : 'Submit'}
        </button>
      </form>
      <h3>Mood is: {state ? state.mood : 'No response yet'}</h3>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Feel free to test this out. When you click the button, it will put a hardcoded "TBD" in the mood label. We want that to be the result of the Hugging Face model. Let's do that now.

2. Pretty simple; React code + Hugging Face sample code = the working app. In other words, take the two code snippets from above and combine them.

```javascript
const fetchMoodOnFormSubmit = async (prevState, formData) => {
  const message = formData.get('message');
  const data = { inputs: message };
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://router.huggingface.co/hf-inference/models/SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions",
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer hf_YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });
  const result = await response.json();
  const mood = result[0][0].label; // <-- THIS IS THE MAIN MOOD
  return { message, mood };
}
```
---
> **Note:**  I had to wrap the input in a data object because the model I chose expects the input to be in a specific format. I also had to unwrap the result a bit. The model returns a list of lists of objects. The outer list is the first sentence, the inner list is the labels, and the object is the label and confidence score. So I just took the first label.

> So just some massaging of the data boundaries and we have a working app. I expect this will be your experience too.
---

## Step 4: Test it out
1. Run your React app and enter a comment in the text box. Click the button and wait for the result. You should see the mood of the comment in the label below the button.

I grabbed a random product review from Amazon and pasted it in the text box. Obviously the buyer was not happy.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ You've successfully integrated a Hugging Face model into your React application.

Using these steps with different models and different React components, you can easily add AI capabilities to your web app. 


## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have ...

- An existing React web app to integrate with.
- A Hugging Face access tokey. [Here's how](https://agilegadgets.com/blog/hugging-face-api-keys-made-easy).
